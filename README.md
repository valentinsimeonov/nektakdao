# Nektak DAO
The On-chain part of Nektak.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

## Disclaimer 

### !!! Until we deploy On-chain, everything is subject to Change.
### !!!!!!! Great Products come from Constantly Tweaking them. Improving them, Changing them, Adding to them and Removing from them.

### !!! Updates will happen in bulk not by commits.

## On-chain Stack

Layer 2: Base

Token: ERC20Votes Token, non fixed supply

Contracts: Solidity, OpenZeppelin

Governance: Snapshot

Treasury: Gnosis Safe

Infra: Docker, Hardhat(or Foundry), Alchemy or Quick Node





## Phase 1
First Iteration without: Work Score + Cycles/Time Multiplier + Token 

Instead: Token + Snapshot + Safe + basic on-chain Governor

We will add Work Score + Cycles/Time Multiplier on later iterations for easier bulding

Basically we are simplyging the app in the beginning, then add everything we need

Deployment Steps





If we compare the DAO to a Highway through the Jungle that takes us from A to B, and we say that the easiest way for us to build that highway is to make first a small, narrow path from A to B, and then once the first small path has been built enlarge the path to become a road and then finally a highway.
If we compare the DAO to this path/road/highway, and we say that point A is our Local Environment and point B is the actual Deployment then we need to make the Local Environment and then deploy some silly Hello World Contract.
